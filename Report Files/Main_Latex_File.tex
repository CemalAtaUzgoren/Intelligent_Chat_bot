\begin{abstract}
The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that helps users by using natural language processing (NLP). A chatbot is an automated dialogue system that uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyse user inquiries and provide appropriate responses. %\cite{chatbot_nlp}
In this project, we developed a working a user service chatbot that can converse with users to assist them in precisely three scenarios: locating the best train ticket in the United Kingdom; predicting delays during a train journey between London Liverpool Street and Norwich; and offering backup plans in case of blockages on the Great Eastern Tracks in Greater Anglia between Colchester and Norwich. Simple and complex user inquiries can be entered into this chatbot, categorising them into one of the pre-existing labels, and provide related responses. The chatbot is based on machine learning (ML) models that is built using Scikit-learn, spaCy pre-trained models for NLP, along with NLTK (Natural  Language  Tool  Kit) and other in-built python libraries. The final chatbot system was able to accuractly and confidently acheive all objects it set out to complete.
