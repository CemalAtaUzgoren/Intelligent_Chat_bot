\section{Conclusion}

This report outlines the efforts made towards creating an interactive chatbot with the ability to purchase online train tickets, predict time arrival time of delayed train and finally assist users when dealing with contingencies. The background and motivation includes the absence of chatbots with the ability to search for live train times. The extraction of train times includes several web scraping methods which require ethical consideration to avoid the misuse of the scripts.\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
At present the GUI has been developed and deployed and integrated into our chatbot which can respond to the user when asked for train tickets. The chatbot will respond to the user to collect the required information regarding the users journey. Several scraping scripts will be deployed to search a list of train ticket websites / services. The cheapest found ticket will be presented to the user with the respective URL to that ticket.\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
Development into regressive neural networks has yielded respectable results using the Keras library to build a draft LSTM model.\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
Future progress will include the refinement and completion of several regression models, with the inclusion of Integration into the chatbot script. The research into assisting the user with contingencies will be completed.
